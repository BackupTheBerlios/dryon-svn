Dryon 0.9:
---------
only a name change, I keeped 0.9 version number since I still think some things
need to be changed/fixed/finished before I can release 1.0

amxbot 0.9:
----------
bugs fixed
- fixed some crashs related to ruby implementation (thread, gc and stack)

changes:
- new format for userfile.txt
- +k mode for kill (auto kick-ban)
- some improvements in the way network is handled
- script config file saved in script_configs folder in bot folder
   (to let multiple bots use the same scripts)


amxbot 0.8:
----------
bugs fixed:
- fixed bug in config reading system ( '\r' character was not removed )
- giving "vo" flags to someone made the bot op AND voice him, now it should only op him
- fixed bug with empty users.txt
- fixed windows interface bug (interface was using 95% CPU)

changes:
- added loadBool and saveBool
- added commands to add,remove and edit userlist (:adduser, :deluser, :edituser)
	these new command result in the inability to add new user to file while the bot is running
	and don't really like this but i have no idea how to solve this for now.
- changed the language used to generate documentation from java to Ruby
- bot now supports Ruby scripts (.rb)
- script data file for script <script>.sma are now <script>.sma.cfg, same format,
	just need to rename them since the script can have two different extension now.
- under windows bot no longer appears in taskbar and has a systray icon
- added flags to command line to change locations of config files

known issues:
- when reloading Ruby scripts, old definition is kept so if you remove a function/method declaration
  and :reload then the function/method will still be available until next bot restart.
